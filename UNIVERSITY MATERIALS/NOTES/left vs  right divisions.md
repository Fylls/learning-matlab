# Left vs Right Division â€“ Matlab

</div>

There are two operators allowing to divide in Matlab:

The **right** division represented by the symbol **/ (slash)**
The **left** division represented by the symbol **\ (Backslash)**

**These two operators differ from each other:**

Using numbers, the right division will be the conventional division we all day make use of, so:

```matlab
8/2 = 2
```

Contrary to the right division, the left division **reverses** the division, meaning:

```matlab
8\2 = 2/8 = 0.35
```
